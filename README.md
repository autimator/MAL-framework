#A framework for Multiagent Learning experiments#
The code is written as part of my Msc. thesis  and uploaded to help researchers and other students get started faster. 

The installation process and code are described in the framework description file. The code is written in QT creator 4.8 and has so far only been tested on Windows machine, it will require a bit of coding to set up on Linux or IOS as well. 
External tools:
*	Gambit version 15.1.1 which can be found here: http://www.gambit-project.org/ 
*	Gamut  version 1.0.1 which can be found here:  http://gamut.stanford.edu/

Next to this the Dlib library (version 19.17) for C++ is needed for the parameter tuning, a description is given of how to set this up in combination with QT. http://dlib.net/ 
And QCustomPlot (version 2.0.1) is used to make the replicator graphs: https://www.qcustomplot.com/index.php/introduction
