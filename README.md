A framework for Multiagent Learning experiments 
============= 
The code is written as part of my Msc. thesis  and uploaded to help researchers and other students get started faster. 

The installation process and code are described in the ___framework description___ file. The code is written in QT creator 4.8 (https://www.qt.io/) and is (so far only) tested on a Windows machine, it will require a bit of coding to set it up on Linux or IOS. 
External tools:
*	Gambit version 15.1.1 which can be found here: http://www.gambit-project.org/ 
*	Gamut  version 1.0.1 which can be found here:  http://gamut.stanford.edu/

Next to this the Dlib library (version 19.17) for C++ is needed for the parameter tuning, a description is given of how to set this up in combination with QT. http://dlib.net/ 
And QCustomPlot (version 2.0.1) is used to make the replicator graphs: https://www.qcustomplot.com/index.php/introduction
